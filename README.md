# WHAT IS IT

**THE PROBLEM:** One of the greatest characteristics that sets apart those that 'succeed' in the professional world is their ability to influence. In consulting and management, not unlike many other careers, influencing requires a near real-time understanding of ones availability and their current delivery efforts.  The purpose of SOL is to provide transparency into staff availability and to capture utilization data.

**SOL:** SOL provides visibility to managers of staff timesheets, hours allocated per project, planned revenue per project, planned vs actual hours, and forecast utilization.  SOL also allows staff to track their work authorizations.

# TECHNOLOGY

**FRONTEND:** JQuery, Node/Express, Charts.js, tables.js, bcrypt, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap

**BACKEND:** Ruby on Rails, Postgres/Mongodb
